      <description>On Wednesday the 9th of January, I attended a CTF tournament arranged by the OWASP Bristol Chapter, SecureCodeWarrior and JustEat at the JustEat offices in London and Bristol.
I thought I’d share my experience competing in the CTF, some of the challenges and what I learnt from them. On a less important note I will also share where I finished on the tournament leaderboard!
CTF Structure As you&amp;rsquo;d guess, this CTF was based solely on web-app vulnerabilities, to be even more specific, the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in web-apps.</description>

      <description>I am really passionate about offensive-security, in particular areas like: reverse-engineering, binary exploitation, web-application testing, code auditing, embedded-systems security etc. In my spare time I like to play CTF competitions and perform security research.</description>
