      <description>I am a 19 year-old security researcher and information-security enthusiast from the United Kingdom. I am interested in all areas of hacking but some of my favourites are:
 Reverse-engineering Binary exploitation Web/Infrastructure penetration-testing  I was first attracted to computer security after being fascinated by cheaters I encountered in online games, specifically the challenge of making a system work in ways unintended. I&amp;rsquo;m driven today by that same fascination and challenge, I think computer security and vulnerability research are the coolest things on Earth.</description>
