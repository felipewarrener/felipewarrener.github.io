      <description>I am a 19 year-old security researcher and information security enthusiast from the United Kingdom, I am interested in all areas of hacking but some of my favourites are:
 Reverse-engineering Binary exploitation Web/Infrastructure penetration-testing  I started looking into computer security after being fascinated by cheaters I encountered in online games, and I am driven by the challenge of making technology work in ways not originally intended.
I am always striving to learn more develop my skills, I occasionally play in CTF tournaments and WarGames as I like a challenge.</description>
